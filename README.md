# OverlappingPanels
OverlappingPanels is a gestures-driven navigation UI library for Android. Compared to DrawerLayout
gestures, the panel gestures are much less likely to conflict with Android 10's system back
gestures. OverlappingPanels can act as a secondary navigation component in apps that use a bottom
navigation bar / tabs as a primary navigation component.
